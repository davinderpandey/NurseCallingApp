                                            Oral and rectal temperature measurements
                                            Do not routinely use the oral and rectal routes to measure the body temperature of children aged 0 to 5 years. [2007]

                                            Measurement of body temperature at other sites

                                            In infants under the age of 4 weeks, measure body temperature with an electronic thermometer in the axilla. [2007]

                                            In children aged 4 weeks to 5 years, measure body temperature by one of the following methods:

                                            electronic thermometer in the axilla

                                            chemical dot thermometer in the axilla

                                            infra-red tympanic thermometer. [2007]

                                            Healthcare professionals who routinely use disposable chemical dot thermometers should consider using an alternative type of thermometer when multiple temperature measurements are required. [2007]

                                            Forehead chemical thermometers are unreliable and should not be used by healthcare professionals. [2007]

                                            Subjective detection of fever by parents and carers

                                            Reported parental perception of a fever should be considered valid and taken seriously by healthcare professionals. [2007]</string>
